Someone pointed me at this set of "Rules of Conduct" for a Minecraft mod community. I was impressed. This is some surprisingly creepy stuff. So one of my hobbies is unpacking material with cleverly hidden emotional manipulations in it, and this looked like a fun thing.

Some of what I pick up is probably not "real", in the sense that sometimes a choice of wording wasn't intentional or doesn't have the implications it seems like. But taken as a whole, I think it's pretty compelling. Note, most abuse is unintentional; there's no reason to assume conscious or aware malicious intent just because someone's like this.

Original text as it was when I forked, except I've replaced the numbers with &lt;ol style="decimal" start=...&gt; so the items can keep their numbering.

Throughout: Ponder the question of who the pronouns refer to. Who is "we"? Who is "us"? Who is *making* the rules? Who is *bound* by the rules?

> # Rules-of-Conduct
The Rules of Conduct, required reading. These rules must be UPHELD by any member of the organization.

"Upheld" is an interesting choice of word. The all-caps thing is hard to read; it might be intended for emphasis, it might be intended to change the meaning. But the key here is that upholding rules goes significantly further than merely following them. To uphold a rule includes rejecting proposed changes or improvements to it. This is not merely a standard of behavior; this is a loyalty oath.

> <ol style="decimal" start="1"><li>We will not make the same mistakes as GCE, or Timeless. If a tyrant has taken total control, we are in our right to remove them as fast as possible, without warning. Even if it means we MUST move to another organization and let the tyrant rot along with old copies of source code.</li></ol>

Right off the bat: Personal attacks. This document is a personal grudge given form. It's not about this community, it's about commenting on other communities. The writing is sloppy at best; "in our right" is not the usual idiom. The emphasis on "MUST" sounds very much like a retroactive justification for something that people didn't like.

What makes a "tyrant", exactly? Is it a single person having absolute authority? Because, as is so often the case, the person complaining about tyranny seems to be demanding a great deal of personal authority.

> <ol style="decimal" start="2"><li>If a user is blocked from the repo, they will REMAIN blocked until we decide to change our minds.</li>

This is a particularly vehement endorsement of inertia. Yes, if you block someone, they remain blocked until you unblock them. Again with the caps for emphasis. But this doesn't seem like a thing which would need to be said, so why's it here?

> <ol style="decimal" start="3"><li>We are not to fuse as many mods as possible into one unholy abomination. Most players like it when a mod is not forced together with five billion others into an unholy chimera.</li>

"We" again. This is a radically different kind of thing, though. The other things have been about how the *community* works, rules for interaction between devs. Suddenly the text jumps over into code design philosophy. Why? Why the assertion about "most" players? Is there a source, or is that just a personal opinion being ascribed to "most" players?

> <ol style="decimal" start="4"><li>No paid benefits in any mod. Look at Vazkii's patreon page if you want examples of what is okay for donation perks.</li>

Still on code/mod design philosophy, but note the difference between this and the previous reference to other people; this one's respectful and possibly relevant. On the other hand, is it *really* a good idea to have a document like this refer to another page without any kind of date indicator? What happens if Vazkii changes? What are the *actual* rules? We may never know. For all we know, Vazkii's rules were different when this was written than they are now.

> <ol style="decimal" start="5"><li>Drama must be shut down fast, and dealt with swiftly.</li>

Note the omission of the actor. *Who* must shut down the drama? And what does it mean to "shut down" drama? This is a wildcard -- this rule gives unspecified persons essentially limitless authority to squelch anything they don't like by calling it "drama".

> <ol style="decimal" start="6"><li>There is to be no enforcing of harsh rules on a mod to get at a specific member.</li>

One has to wonder, if the rules are "harsh", why the rules are not simply fixed. Note again the unspecified actor. Who isn't supposed to enforce these rules? Can we enforce harsh rules on a mod in order to get at a general category of members, or a group of people we dislike?

> <ol style="decimal" start="7"><li>Do not place malicious code in any mod, even if it seems tempting. You will be removed and blocked if you do so. NO EXCEPTIONS.</li>

So is this a harsh rule we can't enforce "in order to get at a specific member"? But I will point out: This is a good rule, except that it wouldn't hurt to clarify what "malicious" means.

> <ol style="decimal" start="8"><li>We are to listen to the community for feedback. Everyone has a voice, waiting to be heard.</li>

This cannot be reasonably reconciled with the demand that drama be "shut down fast". This part sounds good, honestly. I just don't think it carries much weight given the context.

> <ol style="decimal" start="9"><li>If another member attempts to harass another user, even if they are unrelated to this organization, via the real world, for issues relating to this organization and its internal affairs, they will be removed of all power and reprimanded. Keep this via the internet, not the real world. We don't want innocents to get involved with our drama. Phone calls, mail and real world confrontations are examples of harassment via the real world. In addition, if such situations are bad enough, we encourage anyone who is the target of such a member to call the authorities.</li>

The distinction between "the real world" and "the internet" is sort of nonsense. It's not at all obvious why we should distinguish between harassing people via social media and phone calls.

> <ol style="decimal" start="10"><li>All users must comply with the EULA of Minecraft.</li>

Not obvious why this needs to be here, but okay?

> <ol style="decimal" start="11"><li>Apply common sense where the rules seem to lack or check back with the team.</li>

"Common sense" seems like a good idea until you consider who will be deciding what is or isn't common sense.

> <ol style="decimal" start="12"><li>No user is to be rushed in making content, even if they have been behind. Rushed content is the bane of all. In addition, pretty much everyone has a life outside of GitHub and Minecraft modding.</li>

This is a reasonable term that should probably exist.

> <ol style="decimal" start="13"><li>To remove a member from the organization (excluding specific reasons, such as tyranny, non-compliance with the EULA, harassment in the real world, placing malicious code in mods, etc), this must be voted on by everyone.</li>

The writing is shoddy. Most noticably, though, there's no statement on what kind of vote, or who "everyone" is. Do you need a unanimous vote? What happens if someone doesn't respond to a request for a vote, does the whole process wait?

The "specific reasons" include an open-ended "etc", which isn't very specific, and "tyranny" is a pretty open-ended thing without a clear definition.

> <ol style="decimal" start="14"><li>If a user outside of the organization is caught harassing a user of the organization via GitHub, if it happens in our sphere of influence, the user will be blocked from all of the repos. This is based on the rules against "designer harassment" in the ZT2 community.</li>

No definition of what constitutes "harassing", or why this is specific to GitHub (but not Discord or social media), no definition of "sphere of influence", and a vague allusion to rules in "the ZT2 community", but again, what if those rules change?

> <ol style="decimal" start="15"><li>Do not ask any individual for an ETA, as there are none.</li>

There are none? That's unusual, lots of devs produce ETAs. It seems to me like this is more a personal thing.

> <ol style="decimal" start="16"><li>In addition to clause 14, if it happens between two or more individuals on the team, it will be dealt with properly, and if needed, treated by clause 9.</li>

This probably ought to have been closer to the clauses it refers back to, but it appears to come down to "if a member of the team harasses another member via GitHub, it can get them banned as though they had harassed someone in real life", which... What? That's weirdly specific.

> <ol style="decimal" start="17"><li>We will not clamp any organization member's privileges, no matter what their role is, on reasons based on personal grudges and concern trolling. If this is actually required for whatever reason, please specify an actual reason, or don't bother.</li>

This is an incredible example of something that sounds potentially good, but is actually a get-out-of-rules free card for the people running things. Any reason can be dismissed by calling it a "personal grudge" or "concern trolling". Also note that there was no prior reference to "clamping" privileges as a thing possibly different from being "blocked from all repos". So is that supposed to be a different thing?

> <ol style="decimal" start="18"><li>We are not to influence and/or get involved in drama from outside parties unless it is actually of concern to us. This only applies to us acting as a group towards other mods, devs, and modding teams. Any individual is free to contribute to other mods as much as they like.</li>

"Contribute to other mods" does not seem related at all to "influence and/or get involved in drama". But better yet, the wildcard "actually of concern to us". What's actually of concern to us? *Anything we want to be.*

> This document is subject to modification by it's owner, Sunconure11, at any time. If a new rule is required, please send it to him, and it will be evaluated and possibly added.

So we have a single person with absolute authority over the rules, but that's okay, that's not a "tyrant". Note also, this allows adding rules. There's no provision for "if a rule is bad or unclear".

As a whole, this is the kind of document you get when a control freak gets burned by another control freak, and tries to write a thing that makes it totally clear that what happened to them was a horrible injustice, and gives them the power and authority to "defend" themselves, by doing the same thing to other peopl who actually deserve it.

This isn't even *like* a real community code of conduct.

Examples of community codes of conduct that are actually trying to make communities work better:

* [the Go programming language](https://golang.org/conduct)
* [QMK keyboard firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/tools-resources/event-code-of-conduct)
* [AlterConf](https://www.alterconf.com/code-of-conduct)

Note the lack of elaborate things about community administration, because *that is not information about how to behave*.

My advice: I would not agree to participate under rules like this, I would not recommend that other people do, and honestly I'd suggest avoiding the sort of person who would make rules like this. Your mileage may vary.
